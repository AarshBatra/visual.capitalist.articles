Please note:

I have shared 2 datasets in form of 2 Google Sheets (their corresponding 2 figures are in the figures folder link) as together they convey a more meaningful picture. This has been published in this way here: https://explained.media/how-much-longer-can-you-live-if-you-breathe-clean-air/. 

Still, if you'd like - I can combine these 2 graphics together into a single graphic, I'll be happy to make that adjustment. Please do let me know, if you'd like that.

Thank you!
Aarsh
